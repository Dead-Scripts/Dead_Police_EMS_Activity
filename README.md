### PoliceEMSActivity
[![Developer Discord]](https://discord.gg/m39AUuSatU)

    So you want a script in which other emergency services can see their colleagues on the mini map with their locations, but you don't want regular players to see these blips unless they are on duty as well? You want this script to support multiple roles? You want it to be customizable? You want it to use discord for the permission basis of it? Oh well, I have the script for you.

    Essentially, PoliceEMSActivity is a script in which is like a /onduty command, but on steroids. You can use /duty to toggle between being on duty and off duty. With this comes some awesome things too though. There are Blip-Tags people can toggle between if they are in multiple departments. Also, there are webhooks you can set up for each different department and send their clock-ins and clock-outs to when they toggle /duty or log off whilst on duty. There is also a /cops command so you can check to make sure all the people who are using /duty are actually on duty and in RTO (on your discord server voice channels I assume), then punish them accordingly if they use it for metagaming.

    Duration of minutes on tour is now included in the webhook messages!

### Commands
